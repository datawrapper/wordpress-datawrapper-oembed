Registers Datawrapper as oEmbed provider so charts, maps, and tables created with Datawrapper can be embedded in WordPress.

== Description ==

[Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) is an online tool with which you can create interactive and responsive charts, maps, and tables. **Datawrapper is free to use**, so you can create and publish unlimited visualizationas, download them as PNGs and collaborate in teams. The [paid plan](https://www.datawrapper.de/pricing/) is the right choice if you need a custom design, or PDF and SVG export. 

The **Datawrapper oEmbed** plugin lets you paste Datawrapper URLs to embed Datawrapper visualizations in WordPress.com and WordPress.org websites. [Learn more in the Datawrapper Academy](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/203-how-to-embed-charts-in-wordpress).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Datawrapper account to use this plugin? =

You can embed any Datawrapper charts you find, but to publish new charts, maps, or tables you need to create a free account. If you want to [try out Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/chart/create), you can do so without signing up.

= Can I use this plugin if I use the free version of Datawrapper? =

Yes. This plugin will work no matter if you use Datawrapper for free or with a paid plan.

= Why should I embed my Datawrapper visualizations instead of using an image? =

There are a few advantages: 
* Datawrapper visualizations are responsive – images are not. "Responsive" means that the visualization adjusts to the size of your device. You can look at a Datawrapper chart, map or table on a small mobile phone or on a big laptop screen – in any case, text elements like axis labels or descriptions will be nicely readable.
* Your readers can hover over elements e.g. in your maps or line charts to see the underlying values.
* In Datawrapper visualizations, you can link to a data source or let users download the data with a click. Both wouldn't be possible with an image.
